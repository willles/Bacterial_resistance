# Bacterial_resistance
A SAS code for analyzing drug resistance levels for bacteria.  The code will compute the mean frequencies of resistance levels for a specific drug, compute the percentage of a species that is resistant ( or intermediate) vs. not, and sort the organism to the species level while providing the frequency of each resistance level per species.
